      <h2>Our Purpose in Informing others</h2>
      <p>We realize that the best way to help each-other is to communicate first and foremost. By talking and informing others in the need to overcome these barriers, we have taken the first step in greatness, which is to work together for the greater good of all people. </p>
      <p>With this thought process, we asked ourselves what would have been the most optimal way to provide for others who have little knowledge of human trafficing. This leads into our next step to improve the safety and lives of people who want to make a stand.</p>

      <h2>Other Organizations</h2>
      <p>To give people more opportunities to recieve and/or give help, we have partnered with various organizations. These organizations also promote the deconstruction and removal of human trafficing, along with providing aid to people regarding the related materials in the subject matter of human trafficing.</p>
